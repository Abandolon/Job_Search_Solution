To use the application - a simple front end interface from the User point of view is available at [this heroku link](https://job-search-solution.herokuapp.com)

I believe I have followed basics of SOLID Principals, however as it's a new system for me - I cannot be 100% certain.

For testing, I have in place `rspec` for validations testing. 

`User` model is managed by `Devise` gem's authentication and authorization

User Stories:

* As a Visitor, I can view all available Jobs
* As a Visitor, I can search all jobs by title
* As a Visitor, I can search all jobs by spoken language
* As a Visitor, I can view the details of a specific job
* As a Visitor, I can register

* As a User, I can apply for a Job

Requirements:
 [X] Rails 6.0.3.4 (latest)
 [] Tests
 [X] Postgres
 [X] Create a Repository
 [X] SOLID Principals
